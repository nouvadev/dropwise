## About The Project
Do you constantly save links to "read later" but never get back to them? Dropwise is designed to solve the "read-later abyss" problem. It helps you build a consistent learning habit by delivering the articles, videos, and other content you've saved into manageable daily 'drops.'

This project is a full-stack web application developed to showcase both frontend and backend development skills.

## ✨ Key Features
🔗 Easily Save Links: Add new content with a single click.
📝 Add Notes and Tags: Organize your content with personal notes and tags.
📬 Daily Content 'Drops': Prevents information overload by surfacing one piece of content each day.
✨ Clean & Minimalist Interface: A design that lets you focus purely on the content.
📱 Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
